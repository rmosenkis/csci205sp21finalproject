## Project Information
*Our project is based on the Google dinosaur game such that a character has to jump over obstacles. Our project was done
using JavaFX where we created the application to run our game using a MVC. We allow the user to select a character, and 
then the game starts and the user plays until they lose. We also implemented a AI to play the game.*
## How to run it
*Our project is run in GameMain.java using the Gradle run configuration "-PmainClass = GameMain".*
